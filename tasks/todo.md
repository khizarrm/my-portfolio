# Add Amategeko Project to Portfolio

## Plan

1. **Add Amategeko project entry** to the projects array in `/app/page.tsx`
   - Title: "Amategeko"
   - Description: "Legislation app for the Government of Rwanda. Built during internship at WiredIn with team collaboration."
   - Video: "/videos/amategeko.MP4" (already exists in public/videos/)
   - GitHub: null (no links for now)
   - Live: null (no links for now)
   - ID: 6 (next available ID)

2. **Position in array**: Add as the first project (most recent/significant work experience)

## Implementation Details

- Follow existing project structure and naming conventions
- Ensure video path matches the existing file: `amategeko.MP4`
- Use professional description highlighting government collaboration and team work
- Maintain consistency with other project entries that don't have links

## Verification

- Check that video file exists and is accessible
- Ensure project displays correctly in the grid layout
- Verify description is professional and informative
